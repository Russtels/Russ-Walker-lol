This project is an advanced external utility for League of Legends, written entirely in C#. It leverages a hybrid approach of pixel scanning and the official Live Client Data API to provide high-performance, responsive gameplay assistance. The primary goal is to achieve perfect orbwalking (kiting) mechanics, supplemented by other useful automated features.

## ‚ú® Features

* **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è High-Performance Orbwalker:**
    * Executes a flawless attack-move sequence (kiting) by calculating attack windup, attack speed, and ping buffer.
    * Prioritizes champions and maintains movement towards the cursor between auto-attacks.

* **üöú Automated Last Hitting (Auto-Farm):**
    * A dedicated mode (activated by a hotkey) to automatically perform last hits on minions.
    * Uses pixel detection to identify minions with low health that are ready to be last-hit.

* **üõ°Ô∏è Instant Anti-CC Module:**
    * Monitors the screen for crowd control status icons (e.g., Stun).
    * Automatically uses Cleanse or Mercurial Scimitar to instantly remove CC.
    * Scans all item slots to find the correct item and uses the corresponding hotkey.
    * Features a priority system (e.g., Mercurial Scimitar before Cleanse).

* **üñ•Ô∏è Real-time In-Game Overlay:**
    * Displays crucial real-time stats like Attack Speed, Attack Range, and Windup timing.
    * Shows the status of all active modules (Orbwalker, Anti-CC, Cleanse Ready, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The tool operates on two main principles:

1.  **Live Client Data API:** It connects to the local game client's API (`https://127.0.0.1:2999`) to fetch reliable, real-time data such as the player's current Attack Speed, Attack Range, and Champion Name. This data is used for precise timing calculations.

2.  **High-Performance Pixel Scanning:** For information not available via the API (like enemy positions, minion health, or CC status), the tool takes rapid, small screenshots of specific screen areas. It then uses a highly optimized, multi-threaded process to search for predefined pixel patterns that identify targets or status effects.

These two systems work together in a multi-threaded architecture to ensure that screen analysis does not interfere with the low-latency requirements of the orbwalker.

## üìã Requirements

* **.NET 8 SDK**
* **Windows Operating System** (due to the use of Windows API for input simulation and screen reading).
* League of Legends running in **Borderless** or **Windowed** mode for reliable screen captures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3.  Build the project (NuGet packages should restore automatically).
4.  Create an `assets` folder in the output directory (`bin/Debug/...`) and place the reference images for the Anti-CC module there.
5.  All major settings, hotkeys, pixel patterns, and UI coordinates can be configured in the `Values.cs` file.

## üìö Libraries Used

This project relies on a few key NuGet packages:

* **[GameOverlay.Net](https://github.com/michel-pi/GameOverlay.Net):** Used to render the DirectX-based in-game overlay for displaying real-time information.
* **[Hazdryx.Drawing (FastBitmap)](https://github.com/Hazdryx/FastBitmap):** A critical performance library that provides high-speed, direct memory access to bitmap data for ultra-fast pixel scanning.
* **[Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json):** Used for parsing the JSON responses from the League of Legends Live Client Data API.
* **[System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/):** Provides access to fundamental GDI+ graphics functionality, including the `Bitmap` and `Graphics` classes.
